# Syntax Terminators SQL Mini Project
This repository contains an analysis of pre-requisite data necessary to make a US election possible. The dataset provides names of the US states and respective population and number of grand electors. The analysis will enable us to acquire insights on the best campaign strategy that a presidential candidate can utilize to win elections at the least cost possible. Various data analysis techniques will be used to verify data quality, conduct analysis and later draw recommendations based on the study findings.
# Project Description
Since time in memorial, the US elections which occur after every four years have been one of the most competitive and expensive ballots any candidate can partake in. Even though independent candidates are allowed by the constitution to vie, there are only two major political parties from which competition is felt: the Democrats and the Republicans. There is an Electoral college which compiles votes from States, conducts election by grand electors and later confirms the winning candidate. 

There is a total of 538 grand electors in the USA. The winning presidential candidate is one that garners more grand electorate votes (more than half of the 538). Grand electors are attributed at the state level: in each of the 51 states, there is a given number of grand electors to win (roughly, but not exactly, proportional to the size of the state) and the presidential candidate receiving the most local votes wins all the Grand Electors in that state. 

With the costly and competitive nature of the US elections, it would be the aim of this study to deduce the best campaign strategy which would enable a presidential candidate to win an election cost effectively. Since the number of grand electors is not exactly proportional to the population, we will prioritize some of the states in order to increase the return on investment of the campaign for our client. 

The dataset available for this analysis consist of the US states, the population and number of grand electors for each of the states. We will assume that the source of data is credible; the population provided is current and is a true representation of the entire population;the number of grand electors remain unchanged; there are only two presidential candidates and that there is no known history of election trends. Each vote will thus be equally "expensive" to get and some states will grant more grand elector per capita than others. 

The study seeks to answer the following questions: 
* What threshold needs to be met to win the election ?
* How many states make up the priority list?
* List the states that are in  the priority list?
* Which state has the highest number of Grandelectors?
* Which state has the highest population?
* Which states have the least number of Grandelectors?
* Which state has the least population?
* How does the population relate to grand electors? That is, how many people does each vote represent based on a stateâ€™s population?
* How are states tiered in relation to their grand electors?
